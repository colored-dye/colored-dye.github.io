I am Yuntai Bao, a third-year doctoral student at *College of Software Technology, Zhejiang University*.
My research interest includes *mechanistic interpretability (mech interp)*, *AI safety*<aside>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14082</aside>,
and *general principles of ML systems*<aside>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.03296</aside>.
I have experiences in training data attribution, model probes and steering vectors.
Currently, I am interested in *pragmatic interpretability*<aside>https://www.alignmentforum.org/posts/StENzDcD3kpfGJssR/a-pragmatic-vision-for-interpretability</aside>--to enable effective and efficient model control via mech interp.
