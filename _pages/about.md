I am Yuntai Bao, a third-year doctoral student at *College of Software Technology, Zhejiang University*.
My research interest includes [*mechanistic interpretability (mech interp)*, *AI safety*](https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14082),
and [*general principles of ML systems*](https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.03296).
I have experiences in training data attribution, model probes and steering vectors.
Currently, I am committed to [*pragmatic interpretability*](https://www.alignmentforum.org/posts/StENzDcD3kpfGJssR/a-pragmatic-vision-for-interpretability)--to enable effective and efficient model control via mech interp.
