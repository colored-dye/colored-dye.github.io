    Publications:
      - title: Faithful Bi-Directional Model Steering via Distribution Matching and Distributed Interchange Interventions
        authors:
          - Yuntai Bao
        publisher: ICLR 2026
        releaseDate: 2026-01-26
        url: https://openreview.net/forum?id=LoisXFZL3k
        summary: This paper introduces Concept Distributed Alignment Search (CDAS), a steering method that employs a distribution matching objective and distributed interchange interventions to faithfully manipulate internal concept features without overfitting to external preferences. CDAS achieves stable bi-directional control—effectively overriding safety refusals and neutralizing backdoors—while preserving general model utility.

      - title: Scalable Multi-Stage Influence Function for Large Language Models via Eigenvalue-Corrected Kronecker-Factored Parameterization
        authors:
          - Yuntai Bao
        publisher: IJCAI 2025
        releaseDate: 2025-08-16
        url: https://doi.org/10.24963/ijcai.2025/892
        summary: This paper introduces a scalable multi-stage influence function that attributes the predictions of fine-tuned LLMs back to their pretraining data, and this approach efficiently scales to billion-parameter models.

      - title: "Probing the Geometry of Truth: Consistency and Generalization of Truth Directions in LLMs Across Logical Transformations and Question Answering Tasks"
        authors:
          - Yuntai Bao
        publisher: Findings of ACL 2025
        releaseDate: 2025-07-28
        url: https://aclanthology.org/2025.findings-acl.38
        summary: This paper investigates the internal representation of truth in LLMs, revealing that consistent "truth directions" emerge primarily in capable models and generalize effectively across logical transformations and diverse question-answering tasks. The truthfulness probes can be practically applied to selective question answering, improving task accuracy by filtering out incorrect model outputs.
