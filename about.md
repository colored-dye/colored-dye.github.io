Ciao\~ I am Yuntai Bao, an undergraduate currently studying in Zhejiang University. My major is Information Security, but my research interest lies in systems design, especially operating system. I am currently trying to migrate the old project “CoLinux” to 64-bit Windows platforms like Windows 10. Meanwhile, I am taking the MIT 6.824 course online for a glimpse into the world of distributed systems.
