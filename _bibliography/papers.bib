  abstract    = {Intervention-based model steering offers a lightweight and interpretable alternative to prompting and fine-tuning. However, by adapting strong optimization objectives from fine-tuning, current methods are susceptible to overfitting and often underperform, sometimes generating unnatural outputs. We hypothesize that this is because effective steering requires the faithful identification of internal model mechanisms, not the enforcement of external preferences. To this end, we build on the principles of distributed alignment search (DAS), the standard for causal variable localization, to propose a new steering method: Concept DAS (CDAS). While we adopt the core mechanism of DAS, distributed interchange intervention (DII), we introduce a novel distribution matching objective tailored for the steering task by aligning intervened output distributions with counterfactual distributions. CDAS differs from prior work in two main ways: first, it learns interventions via weak-supervised distribution matching rather than probability maximization; second, it uses DIIs that naturally enable bi-directional steering and allow steering factors to be derived from data, reducing the effort required for hyperparameter tuning and resulting in more faithful and stable control. On AxBench, a large-scale model steering benchmark, we show that CDAS does not always outperform preference-optimization methods but may benefit more from increased model scale. In two safety-related case studies, overriding refusal behaviors of safety-aligned models and neutralizing a chain-of-thought backdoor, CDAS achieves systematic steering while maintaining general model utility. These results indicate that CDAS is complementary to preference-optimization approaches and conditionally constitutes a robust approach to intervention-based model steering.

  abstract    = {Pre-trained large language models (LLMs) are commonly fine-tuned to adapt to downstream tasks. Since the majority of knowledge is acquired during pre-training, attributing the predictions of fine-tuned LLMs to their pre-training data may provide valuable insights. Influence functions have been proposed as a means to explain model predictions based on training data. However, existing approaches fail to compute ``multi-stage'' influence and lack scalability to billion-scale LLMs. In this paper, we propose the multi-stage influence function to attribute the downstream predictions of fine-tuned LLMs to pre-training data under the full-parameter fine-tuning paradigm. To enhance the efficiency and practicality of our multi-stage influence function, we leverage Eigenvalue-corrected Kronecker-Factored (EK-FAC) parameterization for efficient approximation. Empirical results validate the superior scalability of EK-FAC approximation and the effectiveness of our multi-stage influence function. Additionally, case studies on a real-world LLM, dolly-v2-3b, demonstrate its interpretive power, with exemplars illustrating insights provided by multi-stage influence estimates.},

  abstract    = {Large language models (LLMs) are trained on extensive datasets that encapsulate substantial world knowledge. However, their outputs often include confidently stated inaccuracies. Earlier works suggest that LLMs encode truthfulness as a distinct linear feature, termed the ``truth direction'', which can classify truthfulness reliably. We address several open questions about the truth direction: (i) whether LLMs universally exhibit consistent truth directions; (ii) whether sophisticated probing techniques are necessary to identify truth directions; and (iii) how the truth direction generalizes across diverse contexts.Our findings reveal that not all LLMs exhibit consistent truth directions, with stronger representations observed in more capable models, particularly in the context of logical negation.Additionally, we demonstrate that truthfulness probes trained on declarative atomic statements can generalize effectively to logical transformations, question-answering tasks, in-context learning, and external knowledge sources.Finally, we explore the practical application of truthfulness probes in selective question-answering, illustrating their potential to improve user trust in LLM outputs.These results advance our understanding of truth directions and provide new insights into the internal representations of LLM beliefs.},

  abstract  = {Real-time music accompaniment generation has a wide range of applications in the music industry, such as music education and live performances. However, automatic real-time music accompaniment generation is still understudied and often faces a trade-off between logical latency and exposure bias. In this paper, we propose SongDriver, a real-time music accompaniment generation system without logical latency nor exposure bias. Specifically, SongDriver divides one accompaniment generation task into two phases: 1) The arrangement phase, where a Transformer model first arranges chords for input melodies in real-time, and caches the chords for the next phase instead of playing them out. 2) The prediction phase, where a CRF model generates playable multi-track accompaniments for the coming melodies based on previously cached chords. With this two-phase strategy, SongDriver directly generates the accompaniment for the upcoming melody, achieving zero logical latency. Furthermore, when predicting chords for a timestep, SongDriver refers to the cached chords from the first phase rather than its previous predictions, which avoids the exposure bias problem. Since the input length is often constrained under real-time conditions, another potential problem is the loss of long-term sequential information. To make up for this disadvantage, we extract four musical features from a long-term music piece before the current time step as global information. In the experiment, we train SongDriver on some open-source datasets and an original àiSong Dataset built from Chinese-style modern pop music scores. The results show that SongDriver outperforms existing SOTA (state-of-the-art) models on both objective and subjective metrics, meanwhile significantly reducing the physical latency.},
